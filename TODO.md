tss# TODO: Fix Image Paths for Online Hosting

## Information Gathered
- The backend's `/upload` endpoint currently returns local URLs (e.g., `http://localhost:4000/images/filename.png`) for uploaded images.
- Product images in the database are stored with these local or dynamic URLs, which don't work on online webhosts.
- The GitHub repository (https://github.com/Abhi420hck/E-Commerce_Website_using_MERN-/tree/main/backend/upload/images) contains the image files.
- To fix, image URLs need to be changed to GitHub raw URLs (e.g., `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abhi420hck/E-Commerce_Website_using_MERN-/main/backend/upload/images/filename.png`).
- Existing products in the database need their `image` fields updated to point to GitHub raw URLs.
- Future uploads should directly return GitHub raw URLs.

## Plan
- [x] Update the `/upload` endpoint in `backend/index.js` to return GitHub raw URLs for new image uploads.
- [x] Add a new endpoint `/updateimages` in `backend/index.js` to update all existing products' image URLs to GitHub raw URLs by extracting the filename from the current URL.
- [x] Run the `/updateimages` endpoint to update the database with the new URLs.

## Dependent Files to be Edited
- `backend/index.js`: Modify the upload endpoint and add the update endpoint.

## Followup Steps
- [x] Start the backend server locally.
- [x] Call the `/updateimages` endpoint (e.g., via Postman or curl) to update existing product images in the database.
- [ ] Deploy the updated backend to the online webhost.
- [ ] Test the frontend to ensure product images display correctly from GitHub raw URLs.
- [ ] If images are not displaying, verify that the image files exist in the GitHub repository at the specified path.
